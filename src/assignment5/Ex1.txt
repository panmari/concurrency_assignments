# Exercise 1 - Unbound lock based queue 

No it's not possible. It could be that two threads are trying to dequeue a queue with 1 element at the exact same time,
with the first thread executing the line

	result = head.next.value;
	
but not the following line yet
	
	head = head.next;

resulting in the second head (that is right now executing the check outside the lock)
to believe that there is indeed an element left in the queue. 

The second thread will then also enter the locked part, put throw a nullpointer exception on

	result = head.next.value;

since next will be null at this point.
